# NFTRolls

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a ERC721 contract, a test without actual testing (I'm too lazy for that), a script that deploys that contract, and an front-end application built with react and Chakra UI, which able to mint some rick roll images.

To compile and serve the contract on a blockchain (Polygon testnet is used on this project), try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

To run the front-end application on a local development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```
